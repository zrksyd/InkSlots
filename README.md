# InkSlots
This is a modding tool for *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* to help automate changing the color of Inkling's ink.

The inputs are 
- `\fighter\common\param\effect.prc`
- `info_melee_lct_ink_ink_bg.bflan` found inside `\ui\layout\info\info_melee\info_melee\layout.arc`

The `layout.arc` is not directly edited since this file has been patched in updates such as 6.0.0 (with Terry) and 9.0.0 (with Steve). The BFLAN must be injected into `layout.arc` using [Switch Toolbox](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox/releases).

Unfortunately, the vanilla BFLAN will not work, but an edited BFLAN is included in the download that is usable.
